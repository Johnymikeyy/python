File Components
Metadata
All the detailed information about a file stored on the computer is called the metadata of that file. 

File attributes are metadata associated with computer files that define file system behavior. Each attribute can have one of two states: set and cleared. 

Read-Only (R) : When set, it makes the file read-only and indicates that a file can not be altered. 
System (S) : When set, it indicates that the hosting file is a critical system file that is necessary for the computer to operate properly.
Hidden (H) : When set, it makes the file hidden and indicates that the hosting file is unseen by default.
